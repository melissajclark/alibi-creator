## Alibi Creator

**By:** Melissa Jean Clark

**For:** Project 1 in HackerYou's Javascript & Jquery class

----

**Branch**: master = Project 1

**Branch**: alibi-jquery = Project 2 (early stages, abandoned to use gh-pages branch)

**Branch**: gh-pages = Project 2 committed to Github Pages

## Project 1 vs. Project 2

- Project 1 was basic JavaScript with old school alerts & prompts
- Project 2 involves building an interface and using jQuery for more advanced interactions

## To Dos / Planned Updates:
-------

### Bugs to Fix

- Yes & No can both be selected
- Professor auto-selects Yes?
- Name field is not required (need to fix since this allows user to see "Undefined" if they skip selecting a name)
- Styling of labels on checkboxes (inheriting gridform styling)


### Features to Add / Updates

- Button to generate more Alibis
- Split content into pages (so user can easily go back and change answers / right now JS hides content)
- Ask user's name
- Sharing buttons
- Fun animations / effects when Alibi is being created
- More questions? 
- More possible answers
