## Ideas 

1. Use jQuery to add <li> items to questions
2. Add other input field when user ticks off "other"

## To Do
1. Ouput alibi summary to screen using javascript
2. Create way to display the generator is thinking (ie. hold on! i'm working on your alibi)
3. Add button to generate more alibis
4. Have alibis relate to user's input

- other text field only appears when other radio field is selected
- if you input a value to the field and click submit, it works
- BUT, if you change the value after clicking submit, it still logs the first value
- need to listen for changes on other text field?

### TO DO 

(November 2, 2014)

1. add "selected" class to elements once selected
2. hide items without selected class
